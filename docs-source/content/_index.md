# What is Hereditas

Hereditas, which means *inheritance* in Latin, is a static website generator that builds fully-trustless "digital legacy boxes", where you can store information for your relatives to access in case of your sudden death or disappearance.

For example, you could use this to pass information such as passwords, cryptographic keys, cryptocurrency wallets, sensitive documents, etc.

## Design

We've designed Hereditas with three principles in mind:

### Fully trustless – really

With Hereditas, you don't need to trust any person or provider. No other person or company has standing access to your data.

As the owner of a Hereditas box, you can nominate some authorized users by whitelisting their email address and giving them a *passphrase*.

To prevent authorized users from having standing access to your data, however, once they log into your Hereditas box for the first time, they need to wait for a few hours or days before they can unlock the box. This gives you, the owner of the box, enough time to stop the timer, by simply logging into the same Hereditas box.

Because Hereditas generates digital legacy boxes that are encrypted bundles within static HTML5 applications, and the passphrase is split between what you give your users and what's stored inside the authorization provider, no company or provider has standing access to your data.

### Simple for your loved ones

We designed Hereditas so it's simple to use for your loved ones, when they need to access your digital legacy box, even if they are not tech wizards.

As the owner of the Hereditas box, you will provide them with a URL and the *passphrase* they need to use to unlock the box. You will also whitelist their email address so they can log in with their existing accounts (e.g. Google, Facebook, Microsoft…) – no need to create new accounts and have new passwords around.

### No expensive and/or time-consuming maintenance

You don't want to rely on a solution that you'll have to keep paying and/or patching for the rest of your life (and in this case, we mean that literally).

Hereditas outputs a static HTML5 app that you can host anywhere you'd like, for free (or almost).
