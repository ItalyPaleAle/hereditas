## What happens to your digital life after you're gone?

![Hereditas logo](./assets/hereditas-logo.png)

Hereditas, which means *inheritance* in Latin, is a static website generator that builds **fully-trustless digital legacy boxes**, where you can store information for your relatives to access in case of your sudden death or disappearance.

For example, you could use this to pass information such as passwords, cryptographic keys, cryptocurrency wallets, sensitive documents, etc.

## Warning: alpha quality software

**Hereditas is currently alpha quality software; use at your own risk.** While we've developed Hereditas with security always as the top priority, this software leverages a lot of cryptographic primitives under the hood. We won't release a stable (e.g. "1.0") version of Hereditas until we're confident that enough people and cryptography experts have audited and improved the code.

**Your help is highly appreciated.** If you are an expert on security or cryptography, please help us reviewing the code and let us know what you think - including if everything looks fine, or if you found a bug.

Responsible disclosure: if you believe you've found a security issue that could compromise current users of Hereditas, please [report it confidentially](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report?package=hereditas).
